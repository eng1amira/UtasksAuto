# UTasks_Auto

This project has both Selenium and cucumber implementation.
it's cross-browsers in the config file, can change chrome to edge

I've implemented the following:
b) Create an account by signing up with a valid e-mail and password. 
c) Add a New Project, add a New Task for it, then set its due date to be: “Next Week”. 
d) Within any existing/old Project, Add a New Task and set its due date to be: “Today”. 

-- changing the email and username in the feature file is needed for the first scenario when run multiple times

There're reports and logging too.
